                <p>Waseda Festival is not the only place to be!</p>
                <p>Waseda Science and Engineering School Festival, or "Rikoten," is held every year in early November at Waseda University's Nishiwaseda Campus.</p>
                <p>This year, after repeated negotiations with the universities, the 70th Rikoten will be held on November 5 (Sat.) and 6 (Sun.), as originally planned, with the main focus on the actual exhibition.
                  In addition, we have prepared online contents such as a website and an app so that visitors can enjoy Rikoten.</p>
                <p>This year, as in previous years, we have prepared a wide range of programs from research presentations and lectures to hands-on experiments for visitor participation, with the aim of enabling visitors to see, feel, and enjoy various aspects of science.
                  Our goal is to provide visitors with the opportunity to see, feel, and enjoy the many facets of science.</p>
                <p>We hope that as many people as possible will have an enjoyable time through the various experiences at the 70th Rikoten. We hope you will enjoy these two special days.</p>

                  <p>Rikoten, the school festival of Science and Engineering in Waseda, is scheduled to be held in person again this year on November 5 (Sat.) and 6 (Sun.), although the situation is still very difficult.</p>
                  <p>This year's theme is "Bloom," which means "to make flowers bloom" in English, and you will see students' abilities blossom in a wide variety of projects.
                    If you want to enjoy both the unique science and engineering projects such as experimental projects and school festival-like projects such as performances on the stage, please come to the festival.</p>
                  <p>Meet you at the 70th Rikoten!</p>

                  <p>
                    The threat of new coronavirus infections continues, but new post-coronavirus
                    lifestyles and business styles have taken hold. Even in universities, pre-corona
                    face-to-face classes have returned, but at the same time, online materials allow students to prepare well enough to
                    and can review them later as many times as necessary.
                    The style of teaching, experiments, and practical training has begun to take hold. However, after all
                    science and engineering is all about seeing phenomena with your eyes and touching them with your hands. You cannot get new discoveries and ideas
                    discoveries and ideas online alone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This year's Rikoten, after taking sufficient measures to prevent infection by the new coronavirus, was held in the same way as the one before the coronavirus.
                    The students who are in charge of managing the Rikoten have prepared experiments and exhibits that can be participated in face-to-face, almost the same as before the coronavirus.
                    By actually confirming the knowledge obtained from the Internet and books, we hope to spark your creativity, satisfy your curiosity, and inspire your dreams.
                    and dream by actually checking the knowledge obtained from the Internet and books. Of course, for those of you who live far away, we also offer a full range of
                    online programs are also available for those who live far away from the exhibition. We hope that you will experience cutting-edge science and technology at Rikoten
                    and technology at Rikoten, we hope that you will gain new insights.

                  <p>Bloom is an English word meaning "to blossom".</p>
                  <p>It not only refers to the buds unfurling, but also to the meaning of breakthrough.
                    It also means a breakthrough, such as "talent blossoming" or "efforts coming to fruition.</p>
